Snake Game
==========

Implementation of the classic Snake Game using CreateJS Suite API and HTML5 + CSS3 technologies

How to play:
- use arrow keys of W, S, A, D for moving the snake
- once the snake starts moving, you can't stop it
- don't touch the walls or the obstacles, otherwise you will die
- don't touch yourself, otherwise you will die
- eating fruits gives points and increase the snake size with 1 unit
- when eating fruits, the snake increase one size in the moving direction, so be sure to have one empty cell in front
- collecting fruits from corners means your chances to die are 100%!
- each fruit type will give a different number of points
- the level advance based on the condition: score >= ((level * (level + 1)) / 2) * 20
- restart game: press F5

Have fun!

TODOs:
- save highest score;
- add restart without reloading the page (no F5 reload...)
- improve graphics, sounds & design
- fix bug: it is possible that some food items apears in corners, and you die sure if collect them. Solution to implement: food items have an expiring period.
